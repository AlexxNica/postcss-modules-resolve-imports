test
====

All tests are automatically generated from the `cases` directory.

To add the new test you should create a directory, which should contain particular files:

- **source.css** — contains the source css;
- **source.json** — contains options for the postcss instance;
- **expected.css** — contains the expected css, which will be compared to resulting css;
- **expected.json** — contains the expected tokens, which will be compared to resulting tokens.
